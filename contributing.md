## Criteria for Addition

This list focuses on maps, indexes, and reports that hav quantifiable data on connectivity. It has a deliberate focus on economically poor countries where affordable connectivity is a challenge.  While qualitative or narrative reports on connectivity are extremely valuable, they are out-of-scope for this list.

- Use [title-casing](http://titlecapitalization.com) (AP style).
- Use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- Link additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.

## Updating your Pull Request

Occasionally I may ask you to edit your Pull Request before it is included. This is normally due to spelling errors or because your PR didn't match the awesome-* list guidelines.
